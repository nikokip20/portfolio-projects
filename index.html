					<a>Hello, my name is Nikolay Dushev I am a recent IT graduate from Middlesex University I am a
						highly motivated and passionate graduate with a solid foundation in computer
						science principles, proficient in various programming languages and development frameworks.
						Seeking to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative software solutions and
						grow within a dynamic development team.</a>

						<h2><a href="">Analysis Data</h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/projectLogo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>As a recent graduate eager to embark on a career as a data analyst, I am excited to dive into the
						world of data analysis and visualization. For this project, I will be analyzing a dataset that
						contains information about Netflix shows released between 2008 and 2021. This dataset offers a
						fascinating glimpse into how Netflix has evolved its content strategy and the variety of
						video-on-demand options it has provided to viewers over the year.The dataset includes detailed
						information about individual movies and series, such as the names of actors and directors,
						release dates, and various categorical variables like content rating (e.g., TV-Y, PG) and type
						(TV Show or Movie). With over 7000 entries, it offers a substantial amount of data to work with.
						However, there are some challenges, such as missing information for directors and cast members,
						which have been addressed by replacing missing values with "unknown" or by excluding overly
						detailed descriptions to streamline the analysis.Through data visualization, I aim to uncover
						meaningful patterns and trends in the dataset, starting with an analysis of the number of shows
						released each year. This project not only serves as a valuable learning experience but also
						demonstrates my analytical skills and passion for turning data into actionable insights.</p>

					<p><b>Background and Motivation :</b></br>
						The rapid evolution of information technologies has integrated computers deeply into various
						facets of our lives, from personal use to professional applications. With this increased
						reliance on digital systems, the prevalence of high-technology crimes has also surged,
						necessitating advanced methods for data recovery and forensic analysis. Tapping and analyzing
						data in storage devices has become crucial for uncovering evidence of criminal activities,
						making file system analysis an indispensable skill for cybersecurity professionals.

						</br><b>Objective:</b></br>
						This dissertation focuses on the analysis of NTFS file systems and the
						development of software tools using Windows PowerShell to recover or find information within
						file systems. Specifically, the project aims to recover deleted files, locate specific
						files—including those hidden using alternative data streams (ADS)—and identify potentially
						harmful files within a system. The objective is to provide a robust solution using native
						Windows tools without relying on third-party software, enhancing accessibility and ease of use
						for forensic investigators and IT professionals.</p>

					<p>This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino to create a touchscreen interface that can
						control MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) devices. The project involves setting up a
						touchscreen to send MIDI signals, allowing users to control musical instruments or software. The
						video covers the necessary components, wiring, and programming required to build this project,
						making it a useful guide for those interested in DIY electronics and music technology</p>
